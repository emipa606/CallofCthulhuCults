Recommended mods
Cosmic Horrors (for summoning actual monsters)
Industrial Age (for great lighting)
Realistic Darkness (for great darkness)

How do I start a cult?
1) Load the mod.
2) Play for a few days in-game.
3) One of your pawns will investigate something horrendous.
4) Build the forbidden research center.
5) Research the strange symbols until someone founds the cult.
6) Good luck.


Tips:
Cult-mindedness is a new feature under 'needs' that keeps track of how likely colonists are to become cultists.
Better apparel means greater worship results and higher success rates for your sacrifices.
Beware! If too many colonists are plotting against the cult, they might take matters into their own hands.
