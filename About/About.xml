[h1]Tips:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Cult-mindedness is a new feature under 'needs' that keeps track of how likely colonists are to become cultists.
[*] Better apparel means greater worship results and higher success rates for your sacrifices.
[*] Beware! If too many colonists are plotting against the cult, they might take matters into their own hands.
